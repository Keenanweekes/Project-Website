			<h2 id="problem">Problem Statement</h2>
			<p>
				<i>Digitally transform work processes associated with Marketing and Business Development activities, specifically the management 
					of prospective and current provider information.</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				South Coast Private Hospital currently manages its provider information in manual form via a number of Excel Spreadsheets.
				This has resulted in hours of lost productivity due to poor data maintenance and provider information being scattered over 
				various versions of the spreadsheets.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Current processes see Marketing and Business Development staff extract provider information from internal systems, add the information
				to the current version of the spreadsheet and subsequently use this information to guide business development activities. The information in the
				spreedsheet offers little insight into the history of provider engagement activities adding to the productivity issues experienced 
				by the Marketing and Business Development team.

			<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
			<p>
				CRM Technologies has developed a solution to solve the current business problem on behalf of South Coast Private Hospital.  
				The solution is a product called South Coast Private CRM (SCP CRM), which is a custom built Customer Relationship Management System.
			</p>
			<p>
				A custom solution was selected after a review of many of the key CRMs used within industry today, as they were assessed to have 
				too many unessessary functionalities and not enough customisability to solve the problem for the Client. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The SCP CRM solution has been designed to solve current productivity issues and transform manual work processes into a modern digital management system.
				The solution includes the following features:
				<ul>
					<li>A single digital resource for tracking all prospective and current provider information</li>
					<li>Ability to track and view a history of provider engagement activities such as meeting history and notes, corresspondence and provision of marketing collateral</li>
					<li>Ability to set engagement activity intervals and be reminded of upcoming activities that are due for completion e.g. a provider has not been visited in the last 12 months</li>
					<li>Automation of regular reporting requirements e.g. number of new providers / number of times a provider has referred patients to the hospital</li>
				</ul>	
			</p>
			<p>
				The SCP CRM will be developed as a responsive web application and designed for use on desktop and mobile devices.
				It will be hosted in a modern AWS Cloud Architecture allowing the product to benefit from the numerous product and service offerings by AWS,
				including their current software security and user management protocols.
			</p>
			<p>
				Technical implementation details of the solution can be found on the <a href="project.html">Project</a> page.
