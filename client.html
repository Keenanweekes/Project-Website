				<p><i>Digitally transform work processes associated with Marketing and Business Development activities, specifically the management of prospective and current provider information.</i></p>
				
				<p>The goals of the project include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Streamline provider information from multiple excel spreadsheets into a digital management system</li>
					<li>Increase productivity by eliminating duplicate work associated with current processes</li>
					<li>Track corresspondence and provision of marketing collateral to providers</li>
					<li>View basic provider statistics and reports</li>

				<h2 id="users">System Users</h2>
				<p>During the research and analysis phase of this project, three system users have been identified:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Marketing and Business Development Manager</li>
					<li>Team Assistant</li>
					<li>Chief Executive Officer</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Marketing and Business Development Manager (Manager)</h4>
				<p>The Manager has been identified as the main user of the CRM.  The Manager will be responsible for the upload and maintenance of CRM data as well as assuming responsiblity for the ongoing maintenance of the deployed CRM.</p>
				<p>The Manager should have full system administrator privileges and the ability to read and write all CRM records and full function access.</p>
				
				<h4>Team Assistant (Assistant)</h4>
				<p>The Assistant will provide CRM data maintenance support.  The Assistant will be responsible for updating CRM records as instructed by the Manager.</p>
				<p>The Assistant should have read and write privileges for provider information only.</p>
				
				<h4>Chief Executive Officer (CEO)</h4>
				<p>The CEO has been identified as an occasional user of the CRM.  The CEO has no responsibilites in the maintenance of the CRM.</p>
				<p>The CEO should have read access to all CRM records and report functions.</p>

				<h2 id="considerations">Client Considerations and Constraints</h2>
				<p>During the research and analysis phase of this project a number of key consideration and constraints were identified:</p>
				
				<h4>CRM Maintenance Post Deployment</h4>
				<p>A key consideration during the design phase of the CRM has been providing a solution that will require minimal maintenance once the CRM has been developed and deployed.
					This has been a key consideration as the Client will be responsible for the ongoing maintenance of the CRM without the assistance of the internal IT Department.</p>

				<h4>Security Requirements</h4>
				<p>Internal policy documentation provided by the Client requires the implementation of a range of security measures to protect CRM records which have been deemed to be 'Confidential Data'. These security requirements include the encryption of database data,
					multi-factor authentication, and user role management protocols.  
				</p>

				<h4>Costs</h4>
				<p>The CRM is to be developed as a low budget project with minimal costs incurred for the development and ongoing maintenance of the CRM.  This constraint limits project development
					to open-source or low cost products.
